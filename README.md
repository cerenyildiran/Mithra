# Mithra Social Media

This project is a social media application built with a React frontend and a Django backend (Django Rest Framework). The platform allows users to create accounts, share posts, like and comment on each other's posts, and search for specific content.

The project is designed for a seamless user experience and is deployed on Heroku for public access.



## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
- **Post Creation**: Users can create new posts and share them on the platform.
- **Likes & Comments**: Users can like posts and leave comments.
- **Category Selection**: A category form on the home page allows users to filter posts by topics such as *Art, Celebrities, Politics,* and more.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for specific posts using the search button.
- **Profile Editing**: Users can edit their profile information, including email, username, and password.
- **Responsive Design**: The platform is optimized for both desktop and mobile use.

## Project Status

The application works perfectly as expected. Users can create posts, like each other's posts, and leave comments. Additionally, there is an "Edit Profile" page where users can update their email address, password, and username.

Significant improvements have been made in CSS for both mobile and web sizes to enhance the user experience. However, when I attempted to deploy the project to Heroku, the CSS broke and caused visual inconsistencies. I am currently working on resolving these issues and deploying the project to Heroku without any degradation in the CSS.


## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, CSS for styling
- **Backend**: Django, Django Rest Framework for API creation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Django ORM)
- **Deployment**: Heroku
